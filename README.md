# Eden API
Eden API is a collection of tools that simplifies and streamlines UI development by providing helpful functionalities. I identified issues with the original implementation of minions ImGUI and redesigned it to align with my own needs and preferences.

Eden is a relatively new platform with plenty of room for growth, and I have many plans for future additions. To stay up to date on new features, please refer to the Roadmap.md located in the documentation folder. This folder also contains valuable documentation on Eden's functions, usages, parameters, and potential errors you may encounter. If you encounter any bugs, please feel free to report them here on Github or on my <a href="https://discord.gg">Discord server.</a>

# Installation
Eden is closed source, meaning you cannot install from GitHub. The github is just a repository demo *featuring* Eden, not actually hosting it per se.
That being said, Installation is as follows: 
<br>
1. Navigate to the MMO Minion Store
2. Select Buy Addons
3. Search by name and search for `Eden`
4. Select Eden Framework by Starschoy
5. Hit Install in the top portion of the page

# Notes
Special thanks to Kali, Anyone, and Rhakin for helping me whenever I needed it in `#lua-programming`.
